Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.

## `bat`

`bat` is a `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.

## `exa`

`exa` is a modern replacement for `ls`, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. `exa` supports icons with the `--icons` flag.

## `fd`

`fd` is a fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. `fd` provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write `fd PATTERN` instead of `find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’`. `fd` is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from `.gitignore` by default.

## `procs`

`procs` is a modern replacement for `ps`, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.

## `sd`

`sd` is an intuitive find & replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to `sed`, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). `sd` has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. `sd` is also 2x-11x faster than `sed`. 

`sed` is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, `sd` is more like `tr`, but on steroids. (thanks [/u/oleid](https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/) for the suggestion).

## `dust`

`dust` is a more intuitive version of `du`, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for displaying disk usage statistics. By default `dust` sorts the directories by size.

## `starship`

The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell.

## `ripgrep`

`ripgrep` is an extremely fast alternative to `grep`, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. `ripgrep` is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects `.gitignore` and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.

## `tokei`

`tokei` is a program that displays statistics about your code. It shows the number of files, total lines within those files and code, comments, and blanks grouped by language.

## `hyperfine`

`hyperfine` is a command-line benchmarking tool. Among many features, it provides  statistical analysis across multiple runs, support for arbitrary shell commands, constant feedback about the benchmark progress and current estimates and more.

## `ytop`

`ytop` is an alternative to `top`, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for displaying information about processes.

## `tealdeer`

`tealdeer` is a very fast implementation of  [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), a command-line program for displaying simplified, example based and community-driven man pages.

## `bandwhich`

`bandwhich` is a CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP or hostname.

## `grex`

`grex` is a command-line tool and library for generating regular expressions from user-provided test cases.

![grex](/images/posts/grex.gif)

[GitHub](https://github.com/pemistahl/grex)

## `rmesg`

`rmesg` is a dmesg implementation in Rust (and available as a library for Rust programs to consume kernel message logs.)

[GitHub](https://github.com/polyverse/rmesg/)

## `zoxide`

`zoxide` is a blazing fast autojumper, intended to completely replace the `cd` command. It allows you to change directories without typing out the entire path name.

## `delta`

`delta` is a viewer for git and diff output. It allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.

## Bonus: `nushell`

`nushell` is a new type of shell, written in Rust. Its goal is to create a modern shell alternative that's still based on the Unix philosophy, but adapted to the current era.
It supports piping and filtering in a way similar to `awk` and `sed` with a column view so that you can combine operations like in `SQL`. (thanks [/u/matu3ba](https://www.reddit.com/user/matu3ba/) for the suggestion).
