A couple of days ago I received a newsletter from [Home.pl](http://home.pl), a pretty known, Polish hosting provider. Their offer troubled me a bit: at first glance prices seemed a bit higher than the competition. I started dig in to be sure that my intuition is right. Two particular options came to my attention:

1. [Home Entry XL](https://home.pl/serwery/dedykowane/entryline)
1. [Home Pro Advanced](https://home.pl/serwery/dedykowane/proline)

Let's quickly compare it with my favorite provider of dedicated servers, i.e. [Hetzner](http://hetzner.de).

All prices are brut (VAT in PL is 23%, in DE is 19%).

(1) after [CPU Benchmark](http://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html)
(2) with [Home.pl](http://home.pl) you must sign up for a contract (fee for 1-3 months)

[Home.pl](http://home.pl) proposed pretty amusing price for the setup. It might indicate that they are still a small company (mitigating the provision cost of new hardware). The idea to have a contract only amplifies possible friction of selling process. Monthly fee for their offerings is much higher and their promotion is cumbersome. Draw your own conclusions, but to me, it's clear that guys at Home.pl just missed the point with such offering...
