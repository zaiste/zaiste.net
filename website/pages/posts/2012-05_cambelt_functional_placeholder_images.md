[Cambelt](http://cambelt.co) is a neat placeholder image service I’ve discovered recently. It introduces some interesting features over its competitors, like custom fonts, or ability to generate icons and simple images. Be sure to check out the [example page](http://cambelt.co/#simple-examples). There is also a Ruby gem, but it seems to me *overengineered*.
